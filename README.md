## Requirement

- or Magisk 20.4+ Android 9+ for restoring from booted system
- or Android 7+ for restoring from TWRP.

## Installing script

A latest script data_restore_v2.xx-MAGISK-TWRP.zip will be copied to the root of Internal storage by installing a Magisk module data_restore_Courier_v2.xx-MAGISK.zip. data_restore_Courier module ONLY delivers the latest version of the script to intSD.
- Download the module and copy it to internal storage.
- In the Magisk App: Modules - Install from storage - select the downloaded data_restore_Courier module - Reboot. 
- Find the data_restore_v2.xx-MAGISK-TWRP.zip script in the root of intSD. Done, now you can use this script.

## Running script

There are 2 variants for running data_restore_v2.xx-MAGISK-TWRP.zip script:
1. From booted system, running from Magisk module installer.
2. Also from TWRP if it is avaialble for a device. 

## Features of restoring data

- Check or put to the root of any storage device a folder `databackup` with all files and archive `data*.tar` created at backuping.
- First the script is looking for `databackup` on mounted USB-OTG, then on extSD and after on intSD. Unmount or extract external storage devices if you need restoring backup from internal SD.
- The script automatically recognizes Multy-volume backup.
- Look at `databackup.log`. Restoring is possible on the same system build number or higher. Also the same Magisk version is required for correct restoring.
- 
### ***From system*** (HTC Android 9, Google Pixels Android 11+, Asus Rog Android 10+)
- Restoring is possible from working system with root, Magisk 20.4+
